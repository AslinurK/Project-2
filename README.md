# AptPost

AptPost is a community microblogging site that's designed with a login feature where a user can login if they are a returning user or create an account with their email & password if they are a new user. The login feature uses the Passport NPM package and stores that information in MySQL Workbench via Sequelize.


This app features user accounts and filtering posts by Neighbor Notifications, Community Schedule, Property Messaging, Property Patrol, Community Board, Marketplace, and Location.


-Neighbor-to-Neighbor Notification: Absolutely anonymous messaging feature allowing residents to conveniently notify their neighbor of a common disturbance for peace of mind and immediate resolve.

-Community Schedule: Say goodbye to tacky time consuming fliers and mass e-mails! Residents and staff can see all property events in one convenient place. 

-Property Messaging: Property staff can conveniently send predefined messaging or make announcements.

-Property Patrol: Enabling the ability to communicate when something in the community isnâ€™t quite right.

-Community Board: Get to know your neighbors through common interest groups, as well as buy, sell or borrow items right in your apartment community.

-Marketplace: Residents and staff have exclusive discounts to local businesses at their fingertips, inviting them to explore and support their community.
